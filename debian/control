Description: an automated system for building LaTeX documents
 This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
 runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
 great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
 intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
 standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm,
 pdftex, makeindex. A good number of standard packages are supported,
 including graphics/graphicx with automatic conversion between various
 graphics formats and Metapost compilation.
